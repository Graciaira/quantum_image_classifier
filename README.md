### Abstract
The need for computational power keeps increasing as industry and academia's problems get harder and harder to solve. Applications such as simulation of large quantum systems like molecules or solving large linear systems can be very expensive in computational cost. This has become one of the reasons for quantum computing development, a computational method that employs characteristics and theories of quantum systems for information processing. Quantum computers promise us exponential speed-up for these kinds of problems.

Although quantum computers' development has been growing rapidly in recent years, the theoretical and technological challenges remain a barrier for a large-scale quantum computer. Quantum computers that exist today have severe limitations, such as limited qubits and limited gate operations due to noise in the processes. Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA) have arisen to be one of the promising strategies in dealing with these limitations. Applications across the fields that employ this strategy have been proposed, including image classification as quantum machine learning applications.

This research proposed a modification scheme of the VQA-based Data Reuploading Classifier (DRC) for MNIST classification. A binary, four-class, and eight-class classification task reached 99.7%, 96.5%, and 86.25% of testing accuracy, respectively, using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and Data Re-uploading Classifier with binary representation (DRC-BR) for classification. An improvement in accuracy compared to the previous related VQA works. This research also proposed a DRCbased quantum convolution scheme. Without using PCA, quantum convolution with DRC-BR classifier for binary and four-class classification task achieved 98.9% and 89.5% of testing accuracy, respectively. A respectable result compared to the classical Convolutional Neural Network with the same amount of parameters.
